Repository For AGAPE ML KNIME workflow and data
In this repository you will find the KNIME workflow with the ML models we selected as most accurate for ACTIVE/INAICTIVE Prediction and the list of molecules and molecular descriptors adopted for this study. 
The file "**Full Dataset_labeled.csv**" contains the whole initial dataset of molecules with reference of the G4LDB title, label and smiles.
The file "**Full dataset_with_descriptors_for_ML**" contains the whole initial dataset of molecules with all the Molecular descriptors and QM properties calculated for each molecule. It can be used as initial input dataset for the KNIME workflow to start the ML process. 
The file "**AGAPE_FINAL_WORKFLOW 1.knwf**" is the KNIME Workflow to be imported into KNIME and opened once imported.
